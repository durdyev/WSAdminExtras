This little server should help you to work with Websphere Application Server.

INSTALLATION:

First of all you need to install Python 2.7, PyQt4 module.
Python 2.7 - http://python.org/download/
PyQt4 - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

or if you use some of linux distributions you can simply run commands like this:
- yum install python
- yum install PyQt4

Usage:
- cd bin
- python createProfile.py -profileName SimpleProfile
Or you can create new profile with GUI. To start GUI for server run in bin directory:
- python serverGUI.py

Then you should configure profile. Open profiles/<profile_name>/config/config.xml.
Or you can configure profile with GUI. To start GUI for server run in bin directory:
- python serverGUI.py

You need to fill default profile field in serverGUI. This field is required.
Or in profile config.xml <default_profile>.

When configuration finished run in bin directory
- python startServer.py

COMMUNICATE WITH SERVER

To upload file on server run in bin directory:
- python client.py -upload <file_path> <profile_name>

To deploy uploaded file on Websphere Application Server run:
- python client.py -custom <profile_name> <template_file_name> "{ [parameter1:value], [parameter2:value], ... }"

where <file_path> is path to ear file, <profile_name> is profile that you want to use, <template_file_name> 
is template of jython script, parameters is %parameters% in your template file in scripts directory.

for example, to uninstall application, you need to run
- python client.py -custom SimpleProfile uninstall "{ [app_name:ru.durdyev.simpleweb.ear] }"

where SimpleProfiel = profile, uninstall = uninstall.template in scripts directory, parameter app_name 
is %app_name% in uninstall.template file.

When you installing application you don't need to fill full path to the application file, just write 
name of uploaded file and profile name.


At goal:
-stop/start server
-stop/start operating system services
-clear server logs
-hot deployment
-maven plugin

Stay tuned.
